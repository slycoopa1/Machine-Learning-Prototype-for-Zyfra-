# Machine-Learning-Prototype-for-Zyfra-
This project is in partnership with Zyfra, that develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry. The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. We are working with data on extraction and purification and that helps us optimize production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.
